## RIE Community Principles & Guidelines


It’s a game! Hopefully the stuff below will help keep it fun for everyone around these parts that plays. 

### Behaviors that are encouraged
* teamwork,
* sharing portal keys,
* recharging each others portals,
* meeting agents in the wild and having real-life interaction with other agents and the community at large,
* taking the initiative to plan your own events,
* contributing intelligence and information on Resistance agents that does not violate the TOS,
* helping players to understand the nuances of the game, and respecting each other

### Behaviors that are discouraged
We try really hard to make sure everyone feels comfortable in the game and in the community created around it. Stuff not to do:
* behavior that persistently or grossly interferes with another player's activities
* behavior that may be deemed threatening or harassing to any player (including resistance players),
* posting content to the community that contains sexually explicit, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive material, 
* spam! use the community and in-game chat as if you were talking to someone in person
* scamming items from another player through misrepresentation,
* selling items or accounts.
* spies and double agents will be banned from the community and if found with multiple accounts reported to Niantic, 
* anyone caught sharing private communications will be ostracized

Actions that result in making RIE an unsafe place as outlined above will force our moderators to take action that may result in a ban from this community and potentially be reported to Niantic.  Communication is encouraged between agents to avoid misunderstandings.   Assume good will when interpreting other agents' actions and expect the same back. 

### Portal Politics
**No one agent "owns" a portal and no one has the right to dictate how other players interact with any portal.**

* All neutral portals are fair game to be captured by any player.
* Only the game mechanics, not another player, limit what links can be made to and from a portal.
* What may seem to be a ignorant action by one person may actually turn out to be a strategic action for another. Do not assume everyone has the same strategic view as you. Remember, only the game mechanics and TOS dictate what can and cannot be done.

### Security

Sensitive information, such as Operation Planning, is best kept private to a restricted group of agents that need to know the information.  This will help prevent leaks and unintended dissemination of information.
Keep your account safe. Moderators of this community will never ask you for your account password. ﻿

### Freedom of Self-Expression
The RI Enlightened recognizes that every player has a voice and should be free to express themselves. However, one’s speech should not negatively impact other players. The discussions in the community are meant to create conversation, not contention. Allow everyone to voice opinions and have their say. Our community is used by people of every race, gender, nationality, background, sexual orientation, gender identity and religion. If what you are about to say makes you stop and think "is this appropriate?", don't post it.

### Complaints
While the RI Enlightened G+ community is a drama-free zone, we take charges of code of conduct violations seriously. The community member charged with a grievance will be considered innocent until proven guilty. Some form of substantiation (e.g., witnesses or screenshots/documentation) showing that the event occurred is required. Any incident brought to the attention of the community will be investigated and reviewed by the group moderators.  It is highly encouraged that agents resolve any issues that have arisen prior to involving the group moderators.
Contact a moderator via private message if you feel you need to lodge a complaint.

**Ok, it's time to move.**
